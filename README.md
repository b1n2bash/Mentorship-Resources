# How to Use This Guide

This Gitbook exists to help the participants of our Portland OWASP mentorship program.  We hope to use it, refine it, and make it helpful to other OWASP members looking for some guidance in mentoring folks across a range of aptitudes.  If you are interested in helping out, please email david.quisenberry@owasp.org.  

The resources are broken up into two sections for now: [Application Security](application-security/overview.md) and [Penetration Testing](penetration-testing/overview.md).  Each section contains an overview briefly describing the section and skills that will be covered in the mentorship materials.  The sections also contain suggested walkthrough materials based on mentee skill level.
